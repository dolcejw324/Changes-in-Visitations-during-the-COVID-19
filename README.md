Changes in Visitations during the COVID-19

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has been the most critical global public health crisis during the past two years. However, the pandemic cannot yet be declared that it is over, and due to the prolonged period of the pandemic, people's visits to public places may be subject to change as a result of policy changes or as a result of acclimating to the pandemic. This study aims to understand changes to Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation-related public spaces visitation before and after the pandemic by using the commercial dataset SafeGraph. 

The data contain anonymized mobile phone records on visit counts to 4.4 million POIs across the US through lo-cation-enabled applications. A POI is a point that represents the geographical location of a place that someone may find interesting. POIs were classified based on the North American Industry Classification System and the one categorized as 71- Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation were extracted. We look at the visitation to public places during the pandemic, starting from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2021, and compare the visitation with those prior to the pandemic. Additionally, we examine which census block each visitor originates from. The second dataset we use is the COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily death cases
